# GuiManager
A small project with code that can be use to create inventory easily for spigot plugin, can simply copy and paste to use!
# Install
You can simply copy the code then paste it into your project and use it as your own code!
# How to use
1. Create new class
2. "extends GuiManager"
3. Fill the code similar to the Example or anything else you want
4. Initialize the Listener code ( copy my code then put it into your own Listener class )
5. Open inventory by "player.openInventory(new ExampleGui().generate());". ExampleGui mean your name of class.

The IS class with IS functions is very easy to use, take a look and I bet you will know how to use it.
